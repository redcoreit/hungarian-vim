# What is this?

Vim friendly Hungarian keyboard layout for Windows.

## Why why why?

"Vi(m) was originally designed for English keyboard layout."\
Ok.

"All coder must use English layout!"\
I know!

"Do you really want to press two keys to write semicolon?"\
stop... I said I get it!

...

Actually it was design for [ADM-3A terminal](https://catonmat.net/why-vim-uses-hjkl-as-arrow-keys).\
So why can't we use other layouts than English?\
Especially if your native language is not English and you are forced to use native layout in your daily whatever.

Now you can see where I'm heading with this :)\
Yeah pimp the poorly design keyboard layout for vim (and for coding)!

## Ok what is your offer?

### The original Hungarian keyboard layout

### The experience

- In reality the `ű` key is between the `á` key and the `Enter` key. -> your left hand (`hjkl`) is far from the `Enter` key.
- You have to `Shift` all the time to produce special chars. -> you are typing slow, and it feels like...controlling some weird puppet-show.
- Your left hand shall leave the home row all the time. -> slow again.
- It's a bit personal but I hate the numpad, and I also hate the numeric row in alphanumeric keyboard. I'm not efficient with those.

### My solution

1. Install hungarian-vim keyboard layout.
1. Remap your home row as `asdf` - `kléá` in your mind (also in .vimrc).
1. Use `AltGr` with your left thumb.
1. Remap your `Esc` to `CapsLock` with a remapper sw (I use PowerToys).
1. Remap your movements regarding special chars, practice, practice.

## The benefits

- You will type much much faster.
- Less home row leave (left hand).
- You can reach the `Enter` key easier.
- Numeric keys can be reached easier.
- Your wrist will thank you.
- Your better half will complaining about the fast typing noise that you produce recently.
- Your colleagues will be envy.

## Tooling

I use [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC) Version 1.4](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134) to create layouts.\
If you want to customzie it or create your own I recommend this tool.
