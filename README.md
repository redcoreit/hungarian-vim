# What is this?

Vim friendly hungarian keyboard layout for Windows.

## Why why why?

I know, I know, stop... I said I get it!

"Vi(m) was originally designed for english keyboard layout."\
"All coder must use english layout!"\
"Do you really want to press two keys to write semicolon?"\
...

Actually it was design for [ADM-3A terminal](https://catonmat.net/why-vim-uses-hjkl-as-arrow-keys).\
So why can't we use other layouts than english?\
Especially if your native language is not english and you are forced to use native layout in your daily whatever.\

Now you can see where I'm heading with this :)\
Yeah pimp the poorly design hung keyboard layout for vim (and for coding)!

## Ok what is your offer?

### The original hungarian keyboard layout

### The experience

- In reality the `ű` key is between the `á` key and the `Enter` key. -> your left hand (`hjkl`) is far from the `Enter` key.
- You have to `Shift` all the time to produce special chars. -> you are typing slow, and it feels like...controlling some weird puppet-show.
- Your left hand shall leave the home row all the time. -> slow again.

### My solution

Install hungarian_vim keyboard layout.\
Remap your home row as `asdf` - `kléá` in your mind (and in .vimrc).\
Use `AltGr` with your left thumb.\
Remap your `Esc` to `CapsLock` with a remapper sw (I use PowerToys).\
Remap your movements regarding special chars, practice, practice.

### The benefits

- You can reach the `Enter` key easier.
- Less home row leave (left hand).
- You will type much much faster.
- Your colleges will be envy.
- Your better half will complaining about the fast typing frequency that you produce recently.
- Your wrist will thank you.
